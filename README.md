The project's objective is to assist the manufacturer in comprehending the elements that affect consumers' propensity to buy new cars. The findings will be utilised to create marketing plans that are specific to the preferences and spending patterns of consumers. While inaccurate findings could result in marketing strategies that are useless and fail to connect with the target demographic, accurate results will positively affect sales and revenue.

Hypothesis
- Every factor influences to whether a consumer buys a new car directly from the manufacturer. We think that the decision to buy a new car is influenced by the manufacturer and model of the car, the price range, and other elements like mileage and services needed.

Considering various factors, we have performed several experiments to prove which factor influences the most.
